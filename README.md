# Jesse 
Jesse(the name is taken from of the legendary trader, Jesse Livermore) is a free and open-source yet advanced crypto trading framework which aims to simplify defining trading strategies and tuning them using artificial intelligence methods such as genetic algorithm and machine learning. 

Jesse is written in TypeScript and uses Google's TensorflowJS for machine learning. The ideal goal of this project is to make it easy for everyone to use it with a minimum understanding of AI and just focusing on your trading strategies.
